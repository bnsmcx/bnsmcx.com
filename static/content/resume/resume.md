My name's Ben and I'm happily working through my senior year studying Computer Science and Cybersecurity.  I've got more than a decade of experience in some very interesting and technical fields.

**I have:** Network+, Security+, Linux+, PenTest+ (July) and a **TS/SCI clearance**

## What it's like working with me

### As a hacker/developer I like to...
* Read actual books on a new tech topic rather than depending on stack overflow.  I love my [O'reilly](https://www.oreilly.com) account.
* Write my code with an overall vision in mind in order to keep future refactoring and expansion simple.
* Get feedback on the stuff I create.  I incorporate notes I'm given into my "pre-ship" checklist.
* Use productivity tools like Joplin and Toggl to track my time and keep accurate notes.
* Use Git repos for everything and commit early, often, and with useful commit messages.

### As a team member I will...
* Tell you if I think something can be done better but be excited to learn why if it turns out I'm wrong.
* Accept it if an inefficiency cannot be fixed at my team's level.

### As a leader I know...
* That you can't treat every member of your team the same because everybody is motivated differently.
* Every project must have a finish line.  Don't drive your team insane by constantly redefining success.


## Yeah, but what about your skillz?
### The Capture the Flag competitions I compete in prove I can solve difficult problems...
* I finished in the top 3% nationally for the [Spring 2021](https://cyberskyline.com/report/N0L30C73J34B) National Cyber League event, top 6% for [Fall 2020](https://cyberskyline.com/report/Y697Q3831920).
* We won the [2021 Cyber Maryland CTF](https://globalmedia.umgc.edu/2021/03/29/umgc-takes-first-place-in-cybermarylands-national-capture-the-flag-competition/?sf244422595=1) and [Magic CTF 2021](https://magicinc.org/) and I've done [Hivestorm](https://www.hivestorm.org/), [MACCDC](https://maccdc.org/), [HTB UNI](https://www.hackthebox.eu/universities/university-ctf-2020), and more.

### Tech I really enjoy working with and I think I'm pretty good at...
* Linux.  I love linux.  I love the command line, [clever one-liners](https://github.com/bnsmcx/utility/blob/master/bash-one-liners), and using VIM.
* Scripting.  I take a ton of pleasure in [automating stuff](https://github.com/bnsmcx/utility/blob/master/ccdc_linux.sh).  Bash is my first love but Python is undeniably cooler.
* Java.  It may not be sexy but I appreciate the way it handles object referencing and garbage collection.  I made this [thing](https://github.com/bnsmcx/hash-master).
* Full stack web development with Python, Flask, and Jinja templates.  I'm currently working on [this](https://github.com/bnsmcx/bnsmcx.com) and, in a private repo I'll share with an interviewer, my own simple blogging plugin for flask that will use a custom Markdown to HTML compiler I'm working on.

### Tech I'm familiar with but I haven't worked with much...
* CSS and HTML.  I've created static web pages and I use markdown with CSS for things like this resume.
* Javascript.  Largely from exploiting vulnerabilities in web apps during CTF competitions.

### Tech I'm really interested in learning...
* JQuery, OAuth, Chrome/Firefox extensions, Bootstratp 5
* Ruby.  It's a beautiful language and it's used to write metasploit modules, which sounds fun.
